Mucking about with Turtle

### This is a title

> Well that makes sense. Azer can’t ‘take down’ open source code. It’s open source.

Open source is about emphasizing community over self. But today’s open source doesn’t really operate that way — at least not in the long tail of smaller, homegrown projects. Whether this is a symptom of “new developers” who need to be properly socialized, as some would suggest, or truly an evolution of open source culture, is still up for debate. I’ll leave that to you.
